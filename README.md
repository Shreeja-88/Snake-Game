# 🐍 Snake Game in Java (Swing)

A classic Snake Game built using **Java Swing**. The game features real-time snake movement, apple generation, score tracking, and collision detection.

---

## 🎮 Features
- Snake moves in four directions (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- Apple appears at random positions on the grid.
- Score increases when the snake eats an apple.
- Snake grows longer after eating apples.
- Game ends when the snake collides with itself or the wall.
- Displays current score and **Game Over** screen.
- After Game Over, the message "Press R to Restart" will appear
- When the user presses R, the snake, score, and apple reset → game starts again immediately.
